MyWinXML is a bridge between WinBinder and PHP while WinBinder is a bridge between PHP and Windows.

With WinBinder extension you will be able to develop windows apps in PHP.But knowing most PHP developers, most of them are web desingers / developers used to markup languages for GUI implementation and i thought "Why not a language for WinBinder and PHP" , thats how MyWinXML came to life.....

MyWinXML is comprised of tags for control placing and event handling.Its functional basisi is entirely based on how i understood WinBinder.Basically Mywinxml parses the xml file(.xpg) and renders your App.
